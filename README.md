Cash out app:

Cashout.c is developed to expidite the closing routine of a restaurant who recieves cash payment. 
During the closing procedure of a restaurant, cash revenue made must be pulled out from the cash register.
The Cashout app takes each amount of individual bills as input (1 $100, 2 $20s, 4 quarters etc) and returns the amount of
money the user needs to take out, with largest bills as priority. 

For example:

If the register starts with $400 in the beginning of the day,

and at the end of the day, the register has:
4 hundreds
1 fifties
3 twenties
2 tens
3 fives
9 twos
29 ones
40 quarters
45 dimes
43 nickels
1 pennies
total = $608.66

the program would output:
2 hundreds
1 fives
1 twos
1 ones
2 quarters
1 dimes
1 nickels
1 pennies
total = 208.66
which is the total revenue made
